We’re the team behind Inturai—a platform that uses advanced AI to transform ordinary Wi-Fi signals into powerful sensors. No cameras, no wearables, no invasive hardware.

Our system detects indoor location of humans and devices, breathing, heart rate, motion and many upcoming events, including falls, fridge opening and even gesture-based commands—entirely through Wi-Fi/RF networks. We're seeking beta users to trial the tech in real-world home environments.
